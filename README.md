# PRLint Reloaded

An alternative implementation for [PRLint](https://github.com/ewolfe/prlint) by [ewolfe](https://github.com/ewolfe), allowing you to validate metadata of pull requests, such as the PR title, using regex patterns.

**Available in [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/prlint-reloaded)**.

This App is compatible with PRLint, as in, it will read the `.github/prlint.json` file.
